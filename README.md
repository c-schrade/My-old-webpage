I am a postdoc currently working at the mathematics department of the WWU Münster. Before I moved to Münster I received my PhD from the University of Regensburg in 2018 under the supervision of Ulrich Bunke and Georg Tamme.
I am interested in higher category theory and abstract homotopy theory as well as applications of K-theory in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.
